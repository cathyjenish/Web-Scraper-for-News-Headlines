# Web-Scraper-for-News-Headlines
This Python script automatically scrapes the latest top news headlines from a public news website (e.g., BBC News) using requests and BeautifulSoup. It collects the headlines from &lt;h2> and &lt;h3> tags and saves them in a clean, readable format to a headlines.txt file.
